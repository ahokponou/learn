# Hello, Cargo!

[Working folder](../projects/)

Cargo is rust build system and package manager. Cargo handles a lot of tracks in a rust project such as building code, downloading the libraries and building those libraries.

To check if cargo is installed: 

```shell
cargo --version
```
## Creating a project with cargo

```shell
cargo new hellocargo # Create a new project called "hellocargo"
cd hellocargo # Move to directory "hellocargo"
```
